        <p><b>Notes on Transformations:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When we get data from different sources, we may find that some parts of that data
            are not homogeneous (for example, one database uses the property name "title" and the
            other uses the property "titulo"). In these cases, transformations help us to transform the
            heterogeneous data in an homogeneous source (all data will be standarized as, for example,
            "book_title").</li>
            <li>Transformations can be a single function or an array of functions. If it is an array,
            the functions of the array will be applied in the order they appear in the array.</li>
            <li>AngularJS provides default transformations for both request and response:
            <code>$http.defaults.transformRequest</code> and <code>$http.defaults.transformResponse</code>.
            They can be accessed through the $http object.</li>
            <li>You can override the default transformations functions in the $http object or even
                add custom ones.</li>
            <li>We will use <code>transformResponse: functionName</code> when we want to transform data
                that comes from the server (for example, a GET operation), and <code>transformRequest</code>
                when we want to transform data that goes from the client to the server (for example,
                a POST operation).</li>
        </ul>



        <p><b>Notes on interceptors:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interceptors allow you to intercept and modify the http configuration object before it is
            sent to the server.</li>
            <li>Interceptors are implemented as services using the factory function.</li>
            <li>There are for kinds of interceptors: request, requestError, response and responseError.</li>
        </ul>
