        <p>The only difference with the Factory Function is that while the Factory Function uses the
        Module Pattern, the Service Function uses the Constructor Pattern. It uses <code>this.</code> to define
        its variables and methods, and it requires the keyword <code>new</code> to be instantiated.</p>

        <p>The Service Function may be more recommendable than the Factory Function when we are
        dealing with cases of inheritance hierarchies. In that case, instantiating a new object using the
        keyword <code>new</code> will ensure that the object inherits properly from its prototype.</p>

        <p>Important: in cases of inheritance as the one demonstrated in the first example, the Service
        function shows its advantage over the Factory Function. If we use the Factory Function here, we
        would have an error.</p>

        <p>Examples of Services created with the Service Function:</p>

        <ul>

            <li ng-repeat="t in transclusions">
                <b>{{ t.name }}</b> - {{ t.description }}
                <p><a ui-sref='{{ t.state }}'>Link to the example</a></p>
            </li>

        </ul>
