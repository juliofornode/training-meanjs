<div ng-controller="W1Controller">

    <p>This is the template of the service created with the Provider Function.</p>

    <p>This service is configurable: we set in app.config if the name of the book will be displayed
    followed of the version number or not.</p>

    <p>In the directive, we add a dependency to the service. That way we are able to display the data provided
        by the service (we have substituted name and age of the first sister with the service data):</p>

    <widget001 user="john" expand="true"></widget001>
    <widget001 user="mary"></widget001>

</div>
