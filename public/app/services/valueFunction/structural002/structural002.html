        Lazy rendering means that this piece of code will be created only if the user clicks the button.
        This is what ng-if does, which is different from what ng-show and ng-hide do (the code is created
        but it has a display:none attribute).
    </p>

    <button class="btn btn-default" ng-click="showit = true">Show it!</button>
