        <p>The Constant Function just registers a service to be used by the dependency injection system. It
            does not call the Factory Function nor the Provider Function.</p>

        <p>A service created with the Constant Function can be injected into a module configuration function
            (aka: app.config())</p>

        <p>A service created with the Constant Function cannot be overriden by a decorator service.</p>

        <p>Examples of Services created with the Value Function:</p>

        <p><b>These values are coming from a service created by the Constant Function:</b></p>
        <ul>

            <li>Country: {{ pais }}</li>
            <li>State: {{ estado }}</li>

        </ul>
