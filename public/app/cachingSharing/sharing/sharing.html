        <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Services are a great way to share data among different controllers in
            our application.</li>
            <li>Services are singletons. That means that there is only one instance of
            each of them. This means also that if we modify the service data, this
            data is going to be changed everywhere the service has been instantiated.
            If, for example, we call the service in a controller using
            <code>myService = $scope.myData;</code> and by that we change the
            content of this object in the controller, we must remember that those
            changes will appear everywhere else the service is being instantiated.</li>
